// Differnce between closure and function

// 1. Capturing Environment:

// Closures: Can capture variables from the surrounding scope. They can borrow (either immutably or mutably) or take ownership of the variables.
// Functions: Do not capture any variables from the surrounding scope. All variables used in a function must be passed as arguments.

// 2. Type Inference:

// Closures: Can often infer types automatically based on the context in which they are used.
// Functions: Require explicit type annotations for all parameters and return types.

// 3. Flexibility:

// Closures: Are more flexible in terms of capturing context. They can be defined in the middle of a
//           function and can make use of variables in the surrounding scope.
// Functions: Are more rigid in terms of scope. They can only use what is passed to them and must be defined separately.

// 4. Traits:
// Closures: Implement one of the Fn, FnMut, or FnOnce traits, depending on how they capture the environment.
// Functions: Implement the Fn trait.

// 5. Memory Allocation:

// Closures: Can capture environment variables which might require heap allocation if they capture non-copy types by value.
// Functions: Do not capture the environment and do not involve such allocations.

// Summary
// Closures: Capture their environment, have type inference, can be more flexible, and are used in scenarios where capturing context is beneficial.
// Functions: Do not capture environment, require explicit type annotations, and are used where capturing the context is
//            unnecessary or when defining reusable code that does not depend on specific local variables.
